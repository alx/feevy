HtmlHelpers 1.1.1
=================

This plugin lets you encode and decode (UTF-8) strings using HTML entities.
Two new methods will be automatically available in your views:

* encode_entities: Encodes a string into a string with HTML entities:

>> <%= encode_entities("Über geek") %>
=> "&Uuml;ber geek"

* decode_entities: Decodes a string with HTML entities into a string:

>> <%= decode_entities("&Uuml;ber geek") %>
=> "Über geek"


What's new in 1.1
=================

Now it's possible to include the helpers in other classes easily by just including Leftbee::HTMLHelpers in your class.

If you *really* need to to use the helpers in a model you can do it like this:

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Leftbee::HTMLHelpers
end

or a controller:

class PersonController < ApplicationController
  include Leftbee::HTMLHelpers
end

etc.


Note: Don't feed the helpers with anything else but UTF-8. If you really need to, convert your string to UTF-8 first using Iconv (http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/iconv/rdoc/index.html)

A basic test unit is included.
