<div class="entrycontent">Monday was the hottest day I'd ever experienced in New York City... until Tuesday.  Tuesday was brutally, inhumanly hot.  It was so hot the temperature actually got above Jocelyn's bra size.  <i>(*rimshot*)</i>  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, I'll be here all week...<br /><br />Tuesday night my friend Dara's air conditioning is on the blink again, so she again comes down to the Bar to hang out in the cooler air while I work the 8-to-close.  Even the Bar's air conditioning is straining to compete with the crowd and the oppressive heat of the day, though; it actually did hit (and maybe even exceed) 100 degrees in mid-afternoon, and people are drinking anything cold they can get their hands on.  This is good for tips.<br /><br />When we manage to find a few moments to catch up here and there, Dara just can't stop talking about how bizarre life is - a few weeks ago, she had a few drinks and said, "Hey, Deb, start a blog," and now there are close to <i>two thousand</i> of you reading what I write.  I have to admit, I find it a little bizarre myself - in fact, downright surreal sometimes - but also very gratifying.  Hey, if I can entertain two thousand people by writing for an hour, then I've spent a pretty good hour.<br /><br />At one point while I'm hustling some drinks, a woman I've seen at the Bar a few times engages Dara in conversation.  I have no idea who she is or what she does, but she's a slim, attractive redhead, always impeccably dressed, and always in the company of a man - a different man each time, if I'm remembering right.  This night is no exception; standing next to her at the bar watching baseball on TV is a pleasant looking young man who is only casually listening to the conversation, not taking part in it.  At least that's true at first; soon enough, the woman introduces Dara to her companion, and the conversation continues three ways.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there's a sudden commotion at the other end of the bar, and a few fists start flying.  Jocelyn screams a little bit as she moves some glasses out of the way and tries to get the fight to stop, but it doesn't stop until Bill, one of the guys working the door, comes over and makes it stop.  He asks what's going on, and I can hardly believe my ears when one of the men who's been scuffling shouts, "This asshole said that Jorge Posada should never catch when Randy Johnson is pitching!!"  Bill can't help but laugh out loud, and soon enough the two guys who were fighting are laughing, too.  The heat does funny things.<br /><br />Things start to quiet down a little with the night's baseball games done with.  Over on the home front, Dara is still chatting with Redhead's companion du jour, but Redhead is now nowhere to be seen.  Soon enough she returns, probably from the ladies room, but she steps up to the bar away from the other two.  I go to take her order, and when I bring back her glass of wine, I ask what she's doing down here instead of with her friends.<br /><br />"Oh, I just thought I'd give those two a chance to get to know each other.  I didn't want to get in the way."<br /><br />"So, you're not with that guy?"<br /><br />She smiles.  "Not in the way you mean."<br /><br />I raise an eyebrow.  "What way do I mean?"<br /><br />She pauses for a few seconds, then leans in conspiratorially.  "Keep a secret?"<br /><br />"That depends on the secret.  Are you a pro of some kind?"<br /><br />"Oh, god, no.  Well, no.  You mean - no, I'm not."  Ooooookay.<br /><br />"So what are you?"<br /><br />"I'm a wingwoman."<br /><br />"So you help your friend meet women?  That's awfully nice of you.  But if he's such a good guy, why aren't you with him yourself?"<br /><br />"No, I'm a wingwoman for hire.  Guys hire me to go out to bars and clubs with them and introduce them to women they want to meet.  It's non-threatening that way, because women feel they can trust another woman."<br /><br />"What won't they think of next," I say more to myself than to her.  And then I realize - she's telling me this because she doesn't know that Dara is my friend.  I'm her confidante because <i>she's</i> seen <i>me</i> in here a few times before, too.  Might as well keep it that way for now, I decide, as long as Dara doesn't do anything stupid like try to leave with this guy tonight, which I trust her not to do.  So I put on a smile, and ask her how she got into this particular line of work.<br /><br />"I saw an ad on Craigslist," says Redhead.  "They were recruiting, and they have their own website, at wingwomen.com.  It's a pretty decent operation.  My clients get to be seen out on the town with an attractive woman, and if they see someone they want to get to know, I try to get to know them first, and introduce them.  I make some money, the client pays for my drinks - and I <i>always</i> make sure they tip well."  She winks a "We're in this together" sort of wink at me.<br /><br />I have to get back to serving drinks, and eventually Redhead finds her way back to Dara and Client Boy.  I see Dara write something down on a piece of paper and hand it to Client Boy, and Redhead says something like, "He's a real sweetheart, isn't he?  I'm glad you two hit it off."  <i>Exeunt</i> Redhead and Client Boy, leaving a twenty on the bar for me.<br /><br />Next time I have a minute to talk to Dara, I start explaining right away, not giving her a chance to dig herself any deeper into a crush on Client Boy (which I already know she must have, at least a little, since she doesn't give her number to just anybody).  She asks me at least three times if I'm serious, and I keep telling her that I am.  Looking up the wingwomen website will have to wait until we get back to my apartment sometime in the wee hours, but I have no doubt the story is true.  All Dara can say is "Wow, that's sketchy."<br /><br />And it is, in my opinion.  Even if the guy is shy and genuinely needs the help - and even if the wingwoman spends time with him to get to know him and genuinely likes him - she's being paid to mislead other women.  Maybe it's a few steps above escort work, but at least pros are selling their <i>own</i> bodies.<br /><br />Dara manages to shrug it off pretty easily.  "Hey," she says, "on the bright side, some guy wanted to meet me so badly that he paid someone to introduce us.  That's kind of flattering."  And it is, I suppose.<br /><br />She sighs a little.  "I'll tell you, though, Deb.  It has not been a great summer for me.  I'm a relationship girl through and through, but it's been a long time for me, and damn if I don't need to get laid right about now."<br /><p>I glance over at Jocelyn, and catch her in the middle of a drive-by flirt with Mario, who's eating up the attention.  As far as I know, the two of them haven't spent a night apart in a week.  I look back at Dara, and nod.  "Sing it, sister."</p><div class='ljtags'>Tags: <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/craigslist'>craigslist</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/dara'>dara</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/jocelyn'>jocelyn</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/johnson'>johnson</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/mario'>mario</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/posada'>posada</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/sex'>sex</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/wingwomen'>wingwomen</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/yankees'>yankees</a></div>

<div class="entrycontent">Friday night I have the 8-to-close shift at the Bar, and I arrive in the middle of a tense Yankees/White Sox game where the lead will ultimately see-saw a few times.  I take over as Jessica cashes out, and I join Amy behind the bar for a decently fast-paced night of serving drinks.<br /><br />The Yankees are trying to hold off a late Chicago rally when a pretty large group of guys enters the Bar all at once, quite rowdy and obviously already drunk.  My first thought is "bachelor party."  They quickly notice that all the tables are full, and two of them piledrive their way to the bar to order drinks.  The first one scans the shelf of tequilas and asks if he can have a full bottle of Cabo Wabo and twelve shot glasses.  As I start to explain that we can't do bottle service unless they're sitting at a table, the second guy turns toward me, does a double-take, and shouts, "Debra!"  It's Peter.  He's an ex-boyfriend.  The One Who Got Away™.  I smile at him, and say, "Hi, Peter."  Somehow I manage to retain my composure, arrange twelve shots of Cabo with a proper supply of lime wedges and a salt shaker on a tray, and hand it off to Peter's friend.  Peter says to me, "I'll be back," and he helps carry the tequila off for the big toast.<br /><br />Cue shimmery camera effects...<br /><br />--<br />Peter worked down the hall from me at my first job out of college, the publishing company where I was an editorial assistant.  He'd been there for a year already when I started.  He was friendly, unlike most of his contemporaries, who took delight in our misery as first-year assistants because they'd been there before.  He treated us like human beings, and soon enough he started treating me special.  We'd been dating for five months when I had my big moment of clarity about publishing as a career, and started thinking about tending bar instead.  He hated the idea - he not only thought I was throwing my future away, he couldn't bear the thought of my dressing in tight shirts and low-rider jeans while hundreds of guys drooled over me just because I was serving them drinks.  I might have been able to manage with his disapproval, but he went past disapproval all the way to ultimatum.  The day I gave notice at the old job, he broke up with me.  If I thought about it in the cold light of day, I knew that I didn't belong with him anyway, if he was going to try to exercise that kind of control over my life and career.  But that was the first time he'd been anything but wonderful, and it was confusing and upsetting.  It took me months to get over it, and I kept hoping he would come back to me after seeing the error of his ways.  He didn't.<br />--<br /><br />An hour and a few dozen shots later, there's a Bar-wide post-Yankees lull, and Peter finds his way back to the bar.<br /><br />"You look great, Deb," he says.<br /><br />"Thanks, Peter, so do you."<br /><br />"How do you manage to keep the horndogs at bay?"<br /><br />"Garlic necklace."  He smiles.  I nod toward his posse.  "Your friend over there getting married soon?"<br /><br />"Yeah," he says.  "Old friend from college, the wedding is Sunday.  He's pretty lit up already.  We're going to leave soon.  We'll probably hit a couple more bars, then head over to Scores."<br /><br />"Charming."  He shrugs, and then neither of us says anything for a minute.<br /><br />"Debra, I'd really like to catch up with you.  Can I call you?"<br /><br />"My phone number hasn't changed," I say as flatly as I can muster.<br /><br />I guess that wasn't the reaction he was hoping for, but it's all I'm prepared to give him at this point.  He nods, a little cowed, then turns and rejoins his group.  A few minutes later they leave, and I wonder if I should've been a little friendlier or more receptive.  It has been three years, after all, and maybe it wouldn't hurt to get together and catch up for real.<br /><p>If he calls.</p><div class='ljtags'>Tags: <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/amy'>amy</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/jessica'>jessica</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/peter'>peter</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/yankees'>yankees</a></div>

<div class="entrycontent">Good morning, all!  I guess it shouldn't surprise me that, along with a large number of readers has come a large number of opinions.  So I wanted to do what I could to clear up a few things and put people's minds at ease.<br /><br />1. My employers and my colleagues know about my blog.  To date, nobody has expressed any reservations about it; I guess either they know me and feel they can trust me, or they don't care.  None of them has the same name in real life as they do on the blog; "Tommy" the barback for instance, is not really named "Tommy," but "Tommy" always refers to the same individual, not some amalgam of barback personalities.  So it's possible they don't care how I describe them because the only ones who actually know <i>whose behavior is being described</i> have already witnessed their behavior first-hand, but that's just my theory.<br /><br />2. A few of the Bar's regular customers (very few) know about the blog, too.  Any customer who knows about the blog and has given me permission to write about him or her has also been renamed for his or her protection.  "Mario" is not really named "Mario."  Generally, customers who haven't given me permission will be referred to in other ways; the best example so far is the three Suits.<br /><br />3. In any event, the <i>only</i> person whose name I haven't changed is my own.  I'm Debra.<br /><br />4. Friday night's <a href="http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/4858.html" target="blank">poll</a> was just to float an idea that a reader had suggested a while back; if a reader likes something one of my customers or colleagues did, wouldn't it be nice if he could buy them a drink?  Well, the poll results and comments were interesting, but as someone pointed out to me on Friday night <i>at the Bar,</i> since I'm already empowered to give people drinks on the house (and as you're aware, I use that power), the online tip jar would mostly be reimbursing the Bar, not really helping me or the people receiving the drinks.  So as much as it was a fun idea, it's relatively pointless.  And since I'm not spending money to maintain this blog, I certainly don't need the tip jar for myself - at least not nearly enough to also put up with the people who think it's greedy.  :-)<br /><br />5. I'd love to help people find work in bartending, barbacking, publishing, etc., and you're always welcome to send me e-mail off-LJ, but I'm probably not going to be of as much help as you'd like.  I left publishing three years ago after only a year in a very low-level job, I backed into bartending almost by accident, and I'm not involved with hiring at the Bar.  So ask away for advice, just don't expect much!<br /><br />6. I can't think of anything else right now.<br /><p>Stay tuned.  An ex-boyfriend re-entered my life on Friday night.  I hope everybody had a good weekend!</p><div class='ljtags'>Tags: <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/bar'>bar</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/blog'>blog</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/names'>names</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/tip+jar'>tip jar</a></div>

<div class="entrycontent">Tuesday night I'm on the 10-to-close, and I arrive about a half hour early because I know Jocelyn's on the 2-10, and I want to catch up with her and see how she's doing.  It's her first shift back since the <i>mishegas</i> of <a href="http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/3559.html" target="blank">last Thursday</a>; it's just as well that it's a Tuesday night in mid-summer with no Yankees game, since it'll probably be somewhat easy-going and not too stressful for her.<br /><br />When I arrive, it is pretty slow and uncrowded.  The All-Star game is on television, but nobody really seems to care.  Even the jukebox is in a mellow mood, or at least whoever fed it is.  Tommy the barback is standing at the end of the bar and having a casual chat with Todd, the manager on duty, which is a pretty good sign of nothing much going on.  Jocelyn and Jessica seem pretty relaxed behind the bar, too, though they're doing a decent business.<br /><br />I ask Tommy and Todd how Jocelyn's shift has gone, and they both agree that she seems just fine.  There have been no rough patches.  Tommy remarks that she's spent most of her downtime over the course of the evening letting Mario chat her up, and I can hear some annoyance in his voice.<br /><br />"What's wrong with that?" I ask him.  "We know Mario, he's cool.  Plus, he helped her out of a jam the other night."<br /><br />Tommy laughs.  "I was there first, or did you forget?"<br /><br />"No, I didn't, Tommy, you did a great job."<br /><br />"So why isn't she -- ah, forget it."<br /><br />I smile.  "Tommy, didn't she thank you that night?"<br /><br />"Well, yeah."<br /><br />"So, now she's thanking Mario.  And only one of you will be tipping her on a regular basis for the foreseeable future.  So you can hardly blame her for taking her time."<br /><br />Todd pats Tommy on the shoulder and laughs.  "Debra's right, bro.  She's probably just being nice to him."  Tommy just shrugs, and goes to collect glasses from the tables.  "I think someone's got a crush on Jocelyn," Todd adds after Tommy's out of earshot.<br /><br />I run through my check-in routine, say hi to Jessica, and then manage to get a couple of minutes with Jocelyn to ask how she's been doing.  She says she was pretty rattled that night, but at the end of her shift she ran into Mario on his way out and asked if he would walk her home.  She says he was a complete gentleman, and gave her his number in case she needed anything.  She leans in a little closer to me, and says, "Every day since, I've <i>almost</i> called him, but I kept chickening out.  I'm really glad he was here tonight."  I raise my eyebrow.<br /><br />I start serving drinks as Jocelyn cashes out, and fall into the routine of a basic Tuesday night at the Bar.  I spend a few minutes chatting with Jessica, and the next time I look up to see if Mario needs a refill, I see Jocelyn standing next to him with her hand on his shoulder, quietly talking into his ear.  He gives a funny little look like he's not sure he's heard what he thinks he's heard, and looks up; she smiles back, and he gets up from his stool.<br /><p>I admit, at first they look a little bit funny together.  Other than her prodigious chest, Jocelyn is tiny - while Mario is solidly built and easily has fourteen or fifteen inches on her in height.  But it looks like the most natural thing in the world when she reaches up, grabs his hand in hers, and leads him out of the Bar.</p><div class='ljtags'>Tags: <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/bar'>bar</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/jessica'>jessica</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/jocelyn'>jocelyn</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/mario'>mario</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/todd'>todd</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/tommy'>tommy</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/yankees'>yankees</a></div>

<div class="entrycontent">Last night, there was a pretty good crowd at the Bar to watch the Yankees night game, as usual.  The boys in pinstripes did their jobs well, and came away with a 5-1 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.<br /><br />I don't think I've mentioned before, but I'm single right now.  I'm a little ashamed to admit, I suspect one of the reasons it's difficult for men to impress me is that I have a crush on Jason Giambi, and who can compete with that?  He's beautiful, he's an incredibly talented athlete, and he plays for the Yankees.  (Okay, he also makes twenty million dollars a year, but officially, that part doesn't enter into the equation for me.)  It seems like whenever he's at bat, I manage to find myself doing something that doesn't involve serving drinks for a minute or two until he's finished.  I know he's married, but I sometimes find myself hoping he'll just stroll into the Bar one night, take my hand, and lead me out the door.<br /><br />Hey.  I can dream, right?<br /><br />Well, last night, Jason had a few at-bats as the Designated Hitter, but didn't do anything very helpful.  That's okay - like I said, the Yankees won, so it's not a big deal, but I enjoy their wins more when Jason has something to do with it.  I got home after 3 in the morning, completely worn out from the busy shift, and fell asleep almost as soon as my head hit the pillow.<br /><br />I dreamed about Jason Giambi.  Oh, yes, I sure did.  And lest there be any doubt in your minds, this was a <b><i>good</i></b> dream.  Let's just say I woke up with a big smile on my face.<br /><br /><small>I'm not ready to share details.  After all, I hardly know - um, all 827 of you.</small><br /><br />Early this afternoon, my roommates Cassie and Jill and I pile onto the Comfy Couch in our PJs, spread out a pile of bagels and cream cheeses and Other Stuff™ on the coffee table (along with some of that fantastic Ethiopian coffee Cassie discovered), and tune in to the 1pm Yankees/Devil Rays game.  Naturally, I have to tell the girls all about my late-night interlude with Mr. Giambi (sorry - as my roommates, they're contractually entitled to the details), and I spend the next half hour regretting it as they torture and tease me about it.<br /><br />Then, in the third inning, Stinnett and Cabrera both walk, and Jeter gets hit by a pitch, loading the bases for - you guessed it, dreamboat himself, Jason Giambi.  <b><i><u>BOOM.</u></i></b>  Right over the centerfield wall, career grand slam number eleven.<br /><br />We celebrate like crazy!  Boys and girls, there are poppy seeds <i>everywhere.</i>  After we settle down a little, Cassie pokes me in the ribs, and says, "That one was for you."  Jill adds, "Yeah, you ought to have sex dreams about him more often, it seems to agree with him."<br /><br />Baby, that's <i>just fine</i> with me.<br /><p><small>P.S. They lost 6-5 anyway.  :-(</small></p><div class='ljtags'>Tags: <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/cassie'>cassie</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/devil+rays'>devil rays</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/jason+giambi'>jason giambi</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/jill'>jill</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/sex'>sex</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/yankees'>yankees</a></div>

<div class="entrycontent">Well, it seems LiveJournal has some funny limitations when it comes to adding and keeping track of Friends.  The "Mutual Friends" section on your profile has a 495-person limit, so even though I kept adding as a Friend everybody who added me, it would only display 495 mutual friends and then everybody else under "Also Friend Of."  Plus, as I just discovered a short while ago, even the "Friends" section on your profile has a 750-person limit.  Ironically, it's only the "Also Friend Of" section that has no numerical limit (though it does have a <i>display</i> limit).<br /><br />So what I've done is deleted everybody from my Friends list.  I'm grateful that you're reading my blog, but because of LJ's limitations, the only way for me to have an accurate sense of how many of you there are is to leave you all unfriended and look at the number under "Also Friend Of."<br /><br />I hope nobody takes offense at that - it's certainly not meant personally and I can always read your journals anytime I want.  :-)<br /><br />And for everybody interested in adding me:  There's no need at all to ask if I mind.  I'd love for you to add me as a Friend and join in the conversation!  Thanks.  :-)<br /><br /><small>792 and counting!!</small>

<div class="entrycontent"><i>Mmmmm, Ethiopian coffee...</i><br /><br />Thursday nights are funny.  Remember in college, when people would try to schedule their classes so that they'd have Fridays off, and they could have three days of going out and weekending instead of two?  Manhattan is kind of like that during the summer.  So many people take Fridays off (or at least Friday afternoons) to go to their summer shares in the Hamptons, or their mountain houses in Rhinebeck, that they think of Thursday night as the beginning of their weekend, and so they go out to bars.<br /><br />This particular Thursday night the Yankees are also playing on TV, so the Bar is packed, loud, and crazy.  Amy and Jocelyn and I are getting slammed.  Our bar karma ("barma"?) seems to be on a downswing, too - the tips have been mediocre (albeit plentiful), people are ordering more mixed drinks than usual, and Amy has dropped five, count 'em <i>five,</i> bottles of beer.  Tommy the barback is pissed at having to clean up all the glass every time she does this, especially while the three of us are running around trying to fill drink orders and practically tripping over him.<br /><br />But it's nothing worse than we've seen before at the Bar, and we're managing to get through it pretty well.<br /><br />In the meantime, there's a group of three Suits bellied up to the bar to watch the game who seem incapable of letting Jocelyn pass by them without hooting "Hey, honey" or "Baaaaaaaaaaby!" or something equally deranged at her.  <a href="http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/1440.html" target="blank">Jocelyn</a>, you may recall, is a short, blonde barmaid who is rather significantly endowed in the breastal area.  She seems to take it all in stride.  I mean, I would imagine* that you can't reach adulthood with breasts like those without getting accustomed to the effect they have on people and how crass those people can get.  And since she is, as usual, wearing a tight t-shirt that shows off her chest to maximum effect, I suspect she enjoys some of the attention - or at least the tips that tend to increase with bra size.<br /><br /><small>(*Let's just get this out of the way right now:  I think I've got a pretty nice pair myself, but they're not big.  They're not tiny, they're not small - I would say they're medium-small.  Above that on the scale would be medium, medium-large, large, udder, pornstar, Jocelyn, and absurd breast fetish pornstar.</small>)<br /><br />As much as she tries to humor these Suits and throw a smile their way every now and then, Amy and I have been trying to take their orders most of the evening.  It's just our way of having her back.  But at one point, Amy and I are just both too occupied with other people's orders when the Suits run dry, and Jocelyn ends up face to face with them.  The Suit in Charge orders for all three of them, and I'm close enough to overhear that he finishes by saying, "You have the most spectacular breasts I've ever seen."  Uh, oh.<br /><br />Women aren't stupid.  We know that guys tend to <i>think</i> stuff like this all the time, and it isn't a problem as long as they leave it mostly unsaid - or if they know us really well and know how we'll react to them saying it before they go ahead and say it.  But there is a line that shouldn't be crossed by strangers, even when their barmaids are dressed a little provocatively.  Maybe that line is a little farther down in New York City than in other places, but there's still a line.  And as much as I may not be positive that the line has already been crossed, I look at the three Suits grinning, giggling, and swaying - and I suspect that if it hasn't yet been crossed, it's surely about to be.<br /><br />While Jocelyn is drawing their beers, I stop Tommy on his way through and half-yell into his ear that I'd like him to keep an eye on the Suits and make sure they don't start any trouble.  Tommy's a good guy with sharp instincts, and is generally pretty good at defusing tense situations without having to take a bouncer off the door.  He nods and sets off to collect glasses from tables, and I turn back to the bar just in time to see the line get crossed.<br /><br />Jocelyn has delivered the Suits' three beers and asked for $18, and Suit in Charge is holding a pair of twenties out in front of him.  "You can have these both," he shouts, "if you show me your breasts."  Jocelyn tries laughing it off, but with the other two Backup Suits hooting and laughing, it's not very clear that her laughing it off will settle the matter.  Besides, he hasn't yet actually handed her any money at all, and they still owe $18 for the beers.  She says, "C'mon, guys," and holds her hand out, but Suit in Charge pulls the twenties back.  Backup Suits hoot some more, and Amy and I both slow down what we're doing and give each other a look.<br /><br />Suit in Charge adds, "You can have a <i>fifty dollar</i> tip, honey, if you let me <i>feel</i> your breasts."  Backup Suits are now hooting, hollering, slapping backs, and starting to pull cash out of their wallets, too.  Jocelyn has a look on her face like someone has run over her dog.  Thankfully, the very next thing that happens is that Tommy has forcibly waded through the crowd to the bar, and is standing behind the Suits.  "Guys, I think you're done for the night," he says.  "Please take your business elsewhere."<br /><br />Suit in Charge adopts a high, nerdy voice (think Eddie Murphy mocking the black California cop in "Beverly Hills Cop"), and repeats back to Tommy, <i>"Guys, I think you're done for the night."</i>  Backup Suit One laughs himself silly.  Only Backup Suit Two seems the slightest bit concerned.  Suit in Charge turns back to Jocelyn, and says, "So how about it, gorgeous?  Easiest fifty bucks you've ever made, just let me feel your tits!"<br /><br />The next moment, my faith in humanity is restored.  Mario, one of our regulars (remember him <a href="http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/2237.html" target="blank">spoiling a Yankees game</a>?), is standing next to Tommy, and says, "Guys, you heard the man.  You're done for the night."  And Mario's got two of his friends standing next to him.<br /><br />The Suits aren't laughing anymore.  Suit in Charge says, "Hey, man, we were just fooling around.  It's not a big deal.  We're cool."  They start to move away from the bar toward the door, and Mario gets in their way.<br /><br />"Pay the lady for your drinks," he says.<br /><br />Suit in Charge hesitates a few seconds, sizing up the situation.  He turns back to the bar, and drops a twenty on it.  The Suits make their way through the crowd to the door, and exit.  Most of the people in the Bar probably haven't even noticed what was going on, but up here at the bar Jocelyn has fallen apart.  She's tearing up and on the verge of crying, and quickly makes her way to the back room so nobody has to see it.  Tommy makes his way back there to make sure she's okay, and Amy and I go back to trying to fill everybody's glasses.  Mario and his friends will drink on the house for the rest of the night.<br /><br />Jocelyn comes back out about ten minutes later, and if she's not fully recovered, she has certainly put on her "fully recovered" face.<br /><p>The rest of the night, her tips are fantastic.</p><div class='ljtags'>Tags: <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/amy'>amy</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/breasts'>breasts</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/jocelyn'>jocelyn</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/mario'>mario</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/tommy'>tommy</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/yankees'>yankees</a></div>

<div class="entrycontent">Hi, all - sorry I haven't posted in a while!  Having only started the blog a couple of weeks ago, it never really occurred to me that people would be so quick to "miss" me.  :-)  But it's sweet of you to inquire.  I'm totally fine - I just had a different holiday weekend than I expected.<br /><br />I was working Friday night when I got a great surprise - at a little before midnight, a friend of mine from high school walked through the door!  Luckily it was slow enough that we were able to spend a little time catching up.  It turns out that Bria works not far from the Bar, on the production staff of a nighttime TV newscast.  She'd just gotten off work, so she stopped by with a few colleagues.  I bought them all a round of drinks on the house, and they tipped the hell out of me the rest of the night, so it worked out well.  :-)<br /><br />Anyway, Bria told me that she'd be heading out to Westhampton in the morning for the rest of the holiday weekend.  Between her late work hours and the nightmare that is Long Island Expressway traffic on a holiday weekend Friday evening (even at midnight), she figured Saturday morning would be a better bet.  Then she asked me if I wanted to join her and her friends in their beach house for the rest of the weekend - with the caveat that I might not get a whole bed to myself, but people were supposedly pretty friendly and casual with sharing space in their house.<br /><br />I immediately asked Todd if I could take Saturday and Sunday nights off, and he said as long as I got someone to cover the shifts, it'd be fine.  Jocelyn overheard us, and said she's dying for hours, so within thirty seconds my plans for the holiday changed 180 degrees.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into a whole lot of detail about the weekend, but it was a bizarre combination of highly relaxing and absolutely exhausting.  The weather cooperated for the most part, though there was some rain - but that just drove the parties indoors.  We ate a few times at this fantastic "shack" called John Scott's, where I ate the best steamers and the best steak sandwiches of my entire life, and we all had some great late-night talks in the house after drinking too much.  I think I have a new group of friends!  It was great reconnecting with someone I cared about but hadn't spoken to in so long.  I got back last night in time to carry out my original July 4 plans, joining my cousin and her husband on their apartment balcony to watch the Macy's fireworks over South Street Seaport, which were lovely.<br /><br />I've mostly recovered, and I had one of the earlier shifts tonight at the Bar, getting off right after the Yankees closed the door on the Indians, 11-3.  A <i>much</i> nicer result than last night's, which we will never mention again.<br /><p>I promise, the next real entry will have more to do with actual barmaidery.  ;-)  I hope you all had a wonderful extended Independence Day weekend!</p><div class='ljtags'>Tags: <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/bria'>bria</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/hamptons'>hamptons</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/jocelyn'>jocelyn</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/john+scott%27s'>john scott&#39;s</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/todd'>todd</a></div>

<div class="entrycontent">I don't have a charming story to tell right now that illustrates the pitfalls of tipping etiquette at a bar.  I'm sure if I wracked my brain I'd be able to come up with a decent one - and I'm also sure that within a couple of days, I'll have a complaint about a specific incident.  But right now, all I want to do is lay out the basics, because it still shocks me how clueless some people are about proper tipping.<br /><br />Are you ready?  Do you have your notepads and your calculators ready?  Tipping at a bar, especially a bar in Manhattan, is a very complex exercise, and I want to make sure you get the formula correct.  Pay attention, now, here comes the formula:<br /><br /><font size="+2">Tip a dollar per drink.</font><br /><br />Okay, I know I went over that pretty quickly, so I'm going to repeat it for the benefit of those who might have had trouble understanding it the first time.  Ready?<br /><br /><font size="+2">Tip a dollar per drink.</font><br /><br />I've had customers go to the trouble of calculating 15%.  If you really want to do that, I'm fine with that - in fact it might end up better for me, especially if you've been drinking $10 martinis or $15 fine single malt Scotch whiskys all night.  But I'll be satisfied with a dollar per drink.  It's an awful lot of trouble to go through anyway, even if it saves you a little money - was it really worth your time to figure out that 15% of your $5.50 beer is 82.5 cents?<br /><br />First of all, I know some fellow barmaids and bar waitresses are going to be a little upset with me.  But let me qualify my tipping advice a little:<ul><li>I'm not suggesting you should limit yourself to a dollar per drink.  If you're happy with your service, you should tip as much as you want.<li>If you're a regular or want to become one, and you want to be treated well on an ongoing basis, you should tip more generously.<li>If you are intentionally undercharged for your drinks by a generous server (which is more likely to happen if you're a regular or you've tipped quite well in the past), you should not only tip generously, you should leave a tip that would be considered generous even if you had been charged the full amount for your drinks.<li>If you're drinking at a more expensive bar, you should tip more in line with the prices - 15%, or perhaps two dollars per drink.</ul><br />Second, I know some customers will also be troubled.  "A dollar per drink?!" I hear you cry - "But I only go during happy hour and I only drink cheap beer, so a dollar would be, like, 25% or 33%!"  Listen, I know it's a lot to ask, but think of it this way:  It takes me just as much time and effort to open and serve you a $3 bottle of Bud Lite as it does to open and serve you a $9 bottle of Delirium Tremens.  This is why waiters get upset when two people split a salad and a few glasses of water for lunch, then take up the table for two hours and leave a tiny tip - just ask Waiter over at <a href="http://www.waiterrant.net" target="blank">Waiter Rant</a>.  I'm just suggesting that the time and effort is worth at least a dollar no matter how low the quality of swill you're swilling.<br /><br />If you have any questions about tipping in a NYC bar, I'll be happy to answer them.  I'd also love to hear people's opinions!<br /><p>Now, then - I'm actually working this weekend, so if you're staying in town, maybe I'll see you around.  Don't worry, though; I don't expect you to tip me enough to make up for the low holiday weekend turnout.  ;-)</p></li></li></li></li>

<div class="entrycontent">When the Yankees have a weekday afternoon game, the YES Network will generally rebroadcast the game at 7pm.  A fair number of people come to the Bar to watch those games at 7pm wanting the results to be a surprise.  So the Bar has a very simple rule on those days:<br /><br /><b>If you spoil the game for <i>anyone in the Bar</i> before the 7pm rebroadcast is over, you buy a round of beer for <i>everyone in the Bar</i> wearing any kind of Yankees paraphernalia.</b><br /><br />Needless to say, a lot of people come to the Bar wearing Yankees gear - including me and my ballcap.  This is true whether the game is live or not - hell, it's true whether there's a game on or not.  That's just because, well, a lot of people in this town are Yankees fans.  That includes me, and I often wear my Yankees cap to tend bar because it's a good excuse to have my hair in a ponytail and because I'll often get better tips from fellow fans that way.<br /><br />Now, I'll grant you, the spoiler rule is an unwritten rule.  But that's mostly because we don't have to invoke it very often.  In my three years at the Bar I remember it happening only four times, and once we let it go because the guy had never been there before and, quite honestly, seemed a little terrified we were going to force him to buy a few hundred dollars worth of drinks.  :-)<br /><br />But now you can make that five times.  Mario is a pretty regular face at the Bar, and he's not exactly known for his verbal restraint in the first place.  But it's still a bit of a shock when he walks in at about 8:30, apparently already having had a few, and shouts so loud that people probably hear him in bars in Atlanta: <b>"Holy <i>shit,</i> did you <i>see</i> A-Rod's goddamn walkoff homer in the twelfth?!"</b>  On the TV, at this moment, the Yankees are losing 1-0.  The assembled fans are not amused.<br /><p>Nor is Mario, after we remind him of the spoiler rule.  He's pretty pissed, actually, until I take him aside and quietly explain that he doesn't have to buy individual pints for everybody, pitchers are fine.  On the other hand, it still works out to fifteen pitchers.  Good thing Mario's having a good year.  :-)  I don't tell him this, but next time he's in, his first drink or two will be on the house.  He's a good sport and a good customer.</p><div class='ljtags'>Tags: <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/bar'>bar</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/yankees'>yankees</a></div>

<div class="entrycontent">People are always complaining about how much drinks cost in New York City, especially in Manhattan.  The complaints are often justified, too - some of the fancier bars, especially in hotels and high-end restaurants, price their drinks astronomically.  Though this be madness, yet there is method in 't.<br /><br />First of all, most bar owners don't own their buildings; they rent their space.  And even if they did own, they'd be paying NYC property taxes.  Real estate here is more expensive than almost anywhere else in the world, and the bar has to pay for it somehow.  So your drinks cost more.<br /><br />The other big factor, as I see it, is less definable but no less real.  It's about how much money is really swimming around New York City.  The truly expensive bars, especially in hotels (particularly "boutique" hotels) and high-end restaurants, charge prices that most "normal" people would never be willing to pay.  The thing about Manhattan, though, is that there will always be people willing to pay more for something they view as prestigious.  That includes paying too much for alcohol, as long as it means they can see and be seen in a boutique hotel bar.  Hell, when you think about it, being thought of as one of the power elite or ultra-cool might really be worth spending $20 on a martini instead of $10 or $12 (which is pretty standard in NYC, for those of you who aren't here).  So it's hard to blame the bars for charging what the market will bear when the market bears it so well.<br /><br />That having been said, where I work - what I refer to as "The Bar" - is somewhere in the middle, or at least at the high end of the low end.  We're a classy enough place, but nobody goes there just because they want to be seen drinking there.  We get our share of celebrities in the Bar, but that's a New York thing - there's no "celebrity culture" here the way there is in Los Angeles, they just happen to live and work and eat and drink right next to us.  So when they show up to drink here, it's because they like the Bar, or because the friends they're meeting like the Bar.  We treat them like normal people (even if the rest of our patrons don't always leave them alone), and they're happy with that.<br /><br />This is just a long-winded way of saying that we don't overcharge, but we charge <i>what the market in this bar</i> will bear.  People who want to pay less for their drinks will go elsewhere, to places that aren't quite as nice or conveniently located.  If we ever start to have smaller crowds because of our prices, well, maybe we'll change our prices.<br /><br />(Not that I have the authority to lower the Bar's prices - I'm just explaining my theory of bar macroeconomics...!)<br /><br />Anyway, for those who want to drink at the nicer places but don't always want to pay the higher prices, the New York Times (registration required, but free) had a nice article the other day about some of the better happy hour bargains to be had around town.  You can read it <a href="http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/travel/25weekend.html" target="blank">here</a>.  In the interest of full disclosure:  None of the establishments mentioned in the article is the Bar.  I'd tell you how to take advantage of the specials at the Bar, but then you'd know where I work... and for now, at least, I'm choosing to remain anonymous.  :-)<br /><p>On the off-chance you think you know where to find me, though, I've got tonight's 6-to-close.</p><div class='ljtags'>Tags: <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/bar'>bar</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/prices'>prices</a></div>

<div class="entrycontent">A rainy Sunday night during the summer is among the deadest times we see at the Bar, topped perhaps only by a rainy Sunday afternoon during the summer.  So it's a perfect time to train and supervise a brand-new barmaid, and it falls to me.  Todd introduces me to Jocelyn, a girl with long, curly blonde hair, and my chin bounces off the floor with a "whap."  She's barely five feet tall, and each of her breasts is about as big as my head.  They're enormous.  She's also wearing a fairly tight t-shirt.  It's impossible not to stare, so I do.<br /><br />"They're real," she grins, and I figure I'll take her word for it.<br /><br />"You're going to make a shitload of money here," I tell her, shaking my head.  We start running through the Bar's procedures, then I let her take some orders.  She's had some experience, according to Todd, but every bar does things a little bit differently.  So it doesn't worry me much when she has a little trouble getting the hang of our register.  She's not great at basic math, either, but then a lot of people in my generation have that problem - we grew up with calculators and computers to do our math for us.  I guess I'm lucky; it's always come naturally to me.  And she doesn't have trouble with, say, three beers at $5 each - but for three drinks at three different prices, she has to think about it for a minute.  But she'll get the hang of it.<br /><br />Her mixology, on the other hand... well, let's just say I thought Todd said she's had some experience.  Anybody who's worked a bar in this city in the last several years has had to mix at least one cosmopolitan - probably a couple hundred of them.  That's Sarah Jessica Parker's fault.  Someone orders a cosmo from Jocelyn, and she hesitates, then starts panicking a little.  It's a good thing I've overheard the order, because the first thing she grabs is rum, and there's no rum in any cosmo I've ever had.  I quietly pull her aside, and whisper in her ear: "Two vodka, one Cointreau, one cranberry juice, squeeze of lime, shaker with ice, strain into a martini glass, lime garnish."  She nods briskly and gets to it.<br /><br />After she's served the cosmo and made change, she comes over to thank me.  "In this bar, you should never be embarrassed to ask someone you're working with how to make a drink you don't know or don't remember," I tell her.  "You should only be embarrassed if you <i>don't</i> ask and then get it wrong.  Then instead of taking ten seconds to explain, we have to take five minutes and ten dollars to make an unhappy customer happy again."<br /><br />She smiles, and says, "I've never thought of it that way.  The other girls at my last bar weren't very helpful - sometimes I think they <i>wanted</i> to see me screw up."<br /><p>I wonder why, I think to myself, staring at her breasts again.</p><div class='ljtags'>Tags: <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/bar'>bar</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/breasts'>breasts</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/cosmopolitan'>cosmopolitan</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/jocelyn'>jocelyn</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/sarah+jessica+parker'>sarah jessica parker</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/todd'>todd</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/training'>training</a></div>

    <span class="entrytimestamptime">07:44 pm</span></div><div class="entrylinkbarpre">     <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/tools/memadd.bml?journal=barmaidblog&amp;itemid=946"><img border='0' width="22" height="20" alt="Add to Memories" title="Add to Memories" src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/btn_memories.gif" /></a> </div>

<div class="entrycontent">It's a crazy Friday night at the Bar, as Friday nights often are.  People are bellied up to the bar three and four deep waiting to order, and when it's that crazy, sometimes it's hard to keep a thought in my head long enough to complete it.  I don't want any distractions at times like these - I just want to get everybody what they order, get their money, give them their change, make sure the tip doesn't get stolen off the bar, and move on as quickly as possible to the next order.<br /><br />Apart from the tables lining the walls, there are exactly twenty barstools right at the bar, and everyone else has to stand.  On a night like this it's hard to say whether snagging one of the barstools is a blessing or a curse.  You get to sit, and you get to flag me down (or try to flag me down, anyway) without having to wade through the crowd first when you want another drink - but the price you pay is that everyone else who <i>does</i> have to wade through the crowd is wading through to where you're sitting.  You get leaned on, jostled, interrupted, maybe even spilled on.<br /><br />Tonight, Amy and I are working like gangbusters.  All I can think about is how bad my feet are going to ache and how much cash I'll be taking home with me.  I'm engrossed in taking and fulfilling orders when Amy crosses behind me on her way to the register and yells in my ear, "The guy with the beard down at the end wants you to serve him!"<br /><br />I'm not an unattractive woman, and I work behind a bar.  So it's nothing new to me to have "fans," as it were.  Men flirt with and shamelessly try to pick up on barmaids constantly.  It's nothing unusual.  But on a night this busy, I think it's pretty weird to have someone ask for me specifically.  I serve a few more customers where I am then I make my way to the other end.<br /><br />"What'll it be?" I ask him, taking a closer look while he smiles at me.  He's probably in his early thirties, not too bad looking.  I don't think he's with the people on either side of him.  He's finishing off something in a lowball.<br /><br />He shouts, "Lagavulin, please, with one ice cube.  And please buy yourself a drink on me."<br /><br />The boy knows his Scotch, he's generous, and he uses "please."  Twice.  I give him a big smile, pour him more than the two fingers' worth of single malt that I should, and open a bottle of Sam Adams for myself.  He gives me a twenty and a five for a $17 tab and gestures for me to keep it, so I say, "Thank you," flash another smile, and go back to trying to keep up with the overwhelming tide of drink orders.<br /><br />Over the next half hour or so, I keep tabs on the boy out of the corner of my eye while serving everyone else.  He's keeping his own tabs on me, too, while he watches the baseball games on our TVs, but he never stares too long, at least that I notice.  I make sure to get back around to him before the Scotch disappears, and ask him if he wants another.  He says yes, and when I return with more Lagavulin, he asks my name.  "I'm Debra," I shout, and he shouts back, "Matt."  He hands me another twenty-five bucks, and says, "Have another on me."  So I do.<br /><br />The next time I find my way back to him, he's smiling like he knows something I don't, and he says, "Can I have your phone number, please?"<br /><br />Well, at least he said please.  "Excuse me?"<br /><br />"I want your phone number!  I want to call you!"<br /><br />"You don't even know me.  I served you a few drinks."<br /><br />"I know you've got a great smile!  And I tipped you really well, like I'm supposed to!"<br /><br />"Supposed to?"  Uh, oh.<br /><br />"Yeah, I read this thing about how to pick up a girl tending bar, it said buy her drinks and always tip really well!"<br /><br />I heave a sigh.  I want to explain to him how idiotic he's being.  I want to remind him that attractive barmaids get hit on about forty-seven thousand times a night, so whether or not it's fair, we kind of have the luxury of being picky about who we respond to.  I want to suggest that perhaps coming to the Bar with friends next time might seem a little less creepy.  I want to point out that before a barmaid - <i>any</i> barmaid - will give a customer her phone number, she might want to, oh, I don't know - know more about him than his name and the fact that he tips well for one hour on one night.  And I really, <i>really</i> want to ask him whether he thinks it's a good idea to reveal to me that he's trying to follow some generic instructions to "pick up a girl tending bar," not trying to get to know me specifically because I seemed like a interesting individual.<br /><br />But this is still a Friday night crowd, it's still a warm summer evening, and I still need to hustle my ass like crazy to keep stemming the tide.  So I don't have time.  Instead, I give him yet another warm smile, grab a napkin and a pen, and write this:<br /><br /><font size="+1"><center>DEBRA<br />212-479-7990</center></font><br /><br />(Go ahead and call, it's entertaining.  It's the <a href="http://www.rejectionline.com/" target="blank">New York City Rejection Line.</a>)<br /><br />Rude?  Maybe.  But on the rare occasions I respond positively to customers who want to get to know me outside the Bar, it's because they take an interest in who I am as a person, not because they try some bullshit Maxim/Stuff/FHM Magazine time-tested method on how to "pick up a girl tending bar."<br /><p>I wish more people understood that.</p><div class='ljtags'>Tags: <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/amy'>amy</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/bar'>bar</a></div>

<div class="entryuserpic"><img src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/48068520/10514411" alt="" height="100" width="100" /></div></div>

<div class="entrycontent">When I first graduated from college in 2002 and moved to New York, it was for an assistant job with the editorial department of a large publishing house.  I thought it would be a glamorous and really interesting way to get into editing literature.  Maybe I'd discover a great novelist and nurture her career, making us both famous and wealthy in the process.<br /><br />I did get to read a lot of submitted novels, but only the "slush pile" - and one of the very first things I learned about the state of American literature is that there are a lot of really, <i>miserably</i> bad novelists out there hoping to get published and sending their manuscripts to every publisher they can think of in hopes of hitting the right one.  And most writers worth reading in the first place are already represented by agents by the time their manuscript shows up at a publisher - so the rule for the slush pile wasn't "Give your boss the good ones," it was "Give your boss only the spectacularly magnificent masterpieces, and anything you think is a spectacularly magnificent masterpiece probably isn't."  Needless to say, since they didn't care very much about the slush pile, I didn't get paid very much to read it.<br /><br />The one big perk of an editorial assistant job is what we called "editorial lunches."  Because we assistants weren't paid very much, it was pretty well understood that at least once a week, we'd take two or three hours for a long, relaxed lunch, and nobody would much care about our absence.  In this case, there was a bar just down the block from our office that had some great Friday lunch specials, so more often than not we ended up there for our editorial lunches.  It also became a handy place to spend an evening or two a week for drinks after work.  Before too long we knew the staff and the managers pretty well, and a friend from work and I decided to do some guest bartending.<br /><br />As far as I know, guest bartending doesn't happen anywhere besides New York City - or at least it didn't happen where I went to college and I haven't heard about it anywhere else.  When you guest bartend, it's a sign you've become a trusted regular.  Sure, the bar benefits because guest bartenders always invite dozens of their friends - but they're trusting you to operate the register, pour drinks without making them 99% booze or charging well prices for top shelf, and not get completely plastered yourself.  The first night Molly and I tended bar in 2003 was an enormous amount of fun!  It was tiring, and my feet hurt afterwards, but I absolutely loved the whole thing.  Mixing drinks wasn't difficult, everyone was really friendly, and I made so much in tips that I started rethinking my career path.<br /><br />I was getting paid crap to do a completely unchallenging job that I didn't enjoy (but hey, at least I had a tiny cubicle).  Sure, if I stuck with it for several years, I might make pretty good money and find my way into a position where I'd have some real influence over the editorial direction of the company and the opportunity to help develop some writing careers.  But the road to that "if" wasn't looking very good.  So a few days after guest bartending I asked Jessica, one of the regular barmaids, if she thought I'd make a good barmaid on a regular, ongoing basis.  She told me that Todd, one of the managers, had said something about me being one of the harder working barmaids he'd ever seen there.  :-)<br /><br />So after some minor soul-searching, a month later I was a barmaid.  It's been three years, and I haven't looked back.  I'm not saying that I never want to do anything more intellectually challenging, but for now I'm having a great time, meeting (mostly) great people, and making pretty good money doing good, honest, hard work.<br /><p>And boy, do I have some stories to tell.  :-)  Stay tuned.</p><div class='ljtags'>Tags: <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/bar'>bar</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/jessica'>jessica</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/molly'>molly</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/publishing'>publishing</a>, <a rel='tag' href='http://barmaidblog.livejournal.com/tag/todd'>todd</a></div>
